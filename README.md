The root directory holds the following subdirectories: R, python and
data. - The directory ‘data’ holds the two .csv files obtained from
Kaggle, from:
<https://www.kaggle.com/parulpandey/palmer-archipelago-antarctica-penguin-data>

penguins\_size.csv and penguins\_lter.csv

The penguins\_size.csv is a smaller data set derived from an original,
containing species: penguin species (Chinstrap, Adélie, or Gentoo),
culmen\_length\_mm: culmen length (mm) - which is the length of the
“beak-ridge” culmen\_depth\_mm: culmen depth (mm) - idem dito -
flipper\_length\_mm: flipper length (mm), body\_mass\_g: body mass (g),
island: island name (Dream, Torgersen, or Biscoe) in the Palmer
Archipelago (Antarctica) and, sex: penguin sex.

penguins\_lter.csv is the original, larger data set

  - Currently, in the directory ‘R’ a Rmarkdown file is stored of the
    analysis of “penguins\_lter.csv”. The weight was analysed in a
    single boxplot according to penguin sex, island (Dream, Torgersen,
    or Biscoe) where the measurement was taken and species (Gentoo
    penguin (Pygoscelis papua), Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) and
    Chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarcticus)).

  - The directory ‘python’ holds a Jupyther notebook containing the same
    code (written in R) as the Rmarkdown, in directory ‘R’
